# IT699 -- Internship --> Work --> continued research ( self ) 01/2023-04/2023


# Overview:
Show ability to utilize 'best practices' in regards to network security, infastrcture, coding, logging/reporting, databasing

Scripting Skills: JavaScript, PHP, Ansible, BASH, Linux, Windows, CLI

Program Utilization: docker, ansible, gitlab, vnc, logs (various types)

# Goal:
Automate network computers into a database which can be visualized through a web interface to show a user which systems are online,
as well as what services are installed on those systems. More I would like to do. Add onto what else should be accomplished. 4/9/2023 <-- reminder -->


# Database layout
- Integrate DNF configuration using Ansible
- Update Servers and continue the process of automating the University Network to be up to date and I dont like this wording because it soudns stupid, but to ensure that packages are properly up to date and compliant with "best practices", and modern standards **[IPv6]**

- Create databases of the current computer clusters which can be accessed through HTML site:

**[Model, GPU,Distribution, Distribution_version, RAM(amount), HD(Size and type), including required IDEs]**

# Database:
- https://atlantic.cs.unh.edu/

# Development
- OCI [ Open Container Iniitiave ]
- docker
    - Containers for CS518
        - https://gitlab.cs.unh.edu/dcj9/it699/-/issues/96
- Gitlab
- podman

# GPU Usage
**[ Containerization ]**
- **Individual containers for different CS classes**
- CS compute images
- CS class projects
    - robots
    - AI
    - nspawn
